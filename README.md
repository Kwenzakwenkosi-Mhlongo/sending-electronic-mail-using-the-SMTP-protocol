# sending-electronic-mail-using-the-SMTP-protocol
I built a GUI-based Java SMTP mail client to understand how email is sent using the SMTP protocol. The application allows users to enter server details, sender and recipient information, and message content, then sends the email using SMTP commands coded from scratch, without using the JavaMail API.
